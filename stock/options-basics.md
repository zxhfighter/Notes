# Options Basics Tutorial

[TOC]

## introduction

Nowadays, many investors' portfolios（投资组合） include investments such as mutual funds（共同基金，美国的一种投资方式）, stocks and bonds（债权）. But the variety of securities（证券，包括股票、债权、期权等） you have at your disposal（任你自由支配） does not end there. Another type of security, known as options, presents a world of opportunity to sophisticated investors who understand both the practical uses and inherent risks（固有风险） associated with this asset class.

The power of options lies in their versatility（多用途）, and their ability to interact with traditional assets such as individual stocks. They enable you to adapt or adjust your position（仓位） according to many market situations that may arise. For example, options can be used as an effective hedge（对冲） against a declining stock market to limit downside losses. Options can be put to use for speculative（投机的） purposes or to be exceedingly conservative（保守）, as you want. Using options is therefore best described as part of a larger strategy of investing.

This functional vzu'll often come across a disclaimer（声明） like the following:

Options involve risks and are not suitable for everyone. Option trading can be speculative（投机的） in nature and carry substantial（可观的） risk of loss. Only invest with risk capital（风险资本）.

Options belong to the larger group of securities known as derivatives（衍生品）. This word has come to be associated with excessive risk taking and having the ability crash economies. That perception（看法）, however, is broadly overblown（浮夸的）. All “derivative” means is that its price is dependent on, or derived from the price of something else. Put this way, wine is a derivative of grapes; ketchup（番茄酱） is a derivative of tomatoes. Options are derivatives of financial securities – their value depends on the price of some other asset. That is all derivative means, and there are many different types of securities that fall under the name derivatives, including futures（期货）, forwards（远期合约）, swaps（互换） (of which there are many types), and mortgage（抵押贷款） backed securities. In the 2008 crisis, it was mortgage backed securities and a particular type of swap that caused trouble. Options were largely blameless（无可指责的）. (See also: 10 Options Strategies To Know.)

Properly knowing how options work, and how to use them appropriately can give you a real advantage in the market. If the speculative nature of options doesn't fit your style, no problem – you can use options without speculating. Even if you decide never to use options, however, it is important to understand how companies that you are investing in use them. Whether it is to hedge the risk of foreign-exchange transactions or to give employees ownership in the form of stock options, most multi-nationals（跨国公司） today use options in some form or another.

This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamentals of options. Keep in mind that most options traders have many years of experience, so don't expect to be an expert immediately after reading this tutorial. If you aren't familiar with how the stock market works, you might want to check out the Stock Basics tutorial first.

## What Are Options

Options are a type of derivative security（证券衍生品）. They are a derivative because the price of an option is intrinsically（本质的、内在的） linked to the price of something else. Specifically, options are contracts that grant the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset（底层标的） at a set price on or before a certain date. The right to buy is called a call option and the right to sell is a put option. People somewhat familiar with derivatives may not see an obvious difference between this definition and what a future（期货） or forward contract（远期合约） does. The answer is that futures or forwards confer（赋予） both the right and obligation to buy or sell at some point in the future. For example, somebody short a futures contract for cattle（牛） is obliged（有义务） to deliver physical cows to a buyer unless they close out their positions（清仓） before expiration. An options contract does not carry the same obligation, which is precisely why it is called an “option.”（也就是说，期权赋予了你在某个时间购买或者卖空某个标的物的权力，但是你可以选择不执行，即没有义务一定要执行这个权力）

### Call and Put Options

A call option might be thought of as a deposit（储蓄、存款） for a future purpose. For example, a land developer may want the right to purchase a vacant lot（空地） in the future, but will only want to exercise that right if certain zoning（分区） laws are put into place. The developer can buy a call option from the landowner to buy the lot at say $250,000 at any point in the next 3 years. Of course, the landowner will not grant such an option for free, the developer needs to contribute a down payment to lock in that right. With respect to options, this cost is known as the premium（保证金）, and is the price of the options contract. In this example, the premium might be $6,000 that the developer pays the landowner. Two years have passed, and now the zoning has been approved; the developer exercises his option and buys the land for $250,000 – even though the market value of that plot has doubled. In an alternative scenario, the zoning approval doesn’t come through until year 4, one year past the expiration of this option. Now the developer must pay market price. In either case, the landowner keeps the $6,000.

A put option, on the other hand, might be thought of as an insurance policy（保险策略）. Our land developer owns a large portfolio（投资组合） of blue chip stocks（蓝筹股） and is worried that there might be a recession（经济衰退） within the next two years. He wants to be sure that if a bear market hits, his portfolio won’t lose more than 10% of its value. If the S&P 500 is currently trading at 2500, he can purchase a put option giving him the right to sell the index at 2250 at any point in the next two years. If in six months time the market crashes by 20%, 500 points in his portfolio, he has made 250 points by being able to sell the index at 2250 when it is trading at 2000 – a combined loss of just 10%. In fact, even if the market drops to zero, he will still only lose 10% given his put option. Again, purchasing the option will carry a cost (its premium) and if the market doesn’t drop during that period the premium is lost.

These examples demonstrate a couple of very important points. First, when you buy an option, you have a right but not an obligation（责任、义务） to do something with it. You can always let the expiration date（行权日） go by, at which point the option becomes worthless. If this happens, however, you lose 100% of your investment, which is the money you used to pay for the option premium. Second, an option is merely a contract that deals with an underlying asset. For this reason, options are derivatives. In this tutorial, the underlying asset will typically be a stock or stock index, but options are actively traded on all sorts of financial securities such as bonds（债权）, foreign currencies（外汇）, commodities（商品）, and even other derivatives.

### Buying and Selling Calls and Puts: Four Cardinal Coordinates（卡迪尔坐标）

Owning a call option gives you a long position in the market, and therefore the seller of a call option is a short position. Owning a put option gives you a short position in the market, and selling a put is a long position. Keeping these four straight is crucial as they relate to the four things you can do with options: buy calls; sell calls; buy puts; and sell puts.

People who buy options are called holders and those who sell options are called writers of options. Here is the important distinction between buyers and sellers:

Call holders and put holders (buyers) are not obligated to buy or sell. They have the choice to exercise their rights if they choose. This limits the risk of buyers of options, so that the most they can ever lose is the premium of their options.

Call writers and put writers (sellers), however, are obligated to buy or sell. This means that a seller may be required to make good on a promise to buy or sell. It also implies that option sellers have unlimited risk, meaning that they can lose much more than the price of the options premium.

Don't worry if this seems confusing – it is. For this reason we are going to look at options primarily from the point of view of the buyer. At this point, it is sufficient to understand that there are two sides of an options contract.

### Options Terminology

To understand options, you'll also have to first know the terminology associated with the options market.

The price at which an underlying stock can be purchased or sold is called the strike price（行权价）. This is the price a stock price must go above (for calls) or go below (for puts) before a position can be exercised for a profit. All of this must occur before the expiration date. In our example above, the strike price for the S&P 500 put option was 2250.

The expiration date（行权日）, or expiry of an option is the exact date that the contract terminates.

An option that is traded on a national options exchange such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is known as a listed option. These have fixed strike prices and expiration dates. Each listed option represents 100 shares of company stock (known as a contract).

For call options, the option is said to be in-the-money（价内期权，股价高于行权价） if the share price is above the strike price. A put option is in-the-money when the share price is below the strike price. The amount by which an option is in-the-money is referred to as intrinsic value（内在价值）. An option is out-of-the-money（价外期权，股价低于行权价） if the price of the underlying remains below the strike price (for a call), or above the strike price (for a put). An option is at-the-money（等价期权） when the price of the underlying is on or very close to the strike price.

As mentioned above, the total cost (the price) of an option is called the premium. This price is determined by factors including the stock price（股价）, strike price（行权价）, time remaining（剩余时间） until expiration (time value) and volatility（波动率）. Because of all these factors, determining the premium of an option is complicated and largely beyond the scope of this tutorial, although we will discuss it briefly.

Although employee stock options aren't available for just anyone to trade, this type of option could, in a way, be classified as a type of call option. Many companies use stock options as a way to attract and to keep talented employees, especially management. They are similar to regular stock options in that the holder has the right but not the obligation to purchase company stock. The contract, however, exists only between the holder and the company and cannot typically be exchanged with anybody else, whereas a normal option is a contract between two parties that are completely unrelated to the company and can be traded freely.


## Why Use Options?

There are a number of reasons an investor would use options. These include speculation（投机）, hedging（对冲）, spreading（分散投资）, and creating synthetic positions（合成仓位）. There are other less common uses for options that won’t be discussed here.

### Speculation

Speculation is making a bet on the outcome of the future price of something. A speculator might think the price of a stock will go up, perhaps based on a gut feeling（直觉） and hopes to make a short term profit by selling that stock at a higher price. Speculating in this way with a call option – instead of buying the stock outright（直接的） – is attractive to some traders since options provide leverage（杠杆）. An out-of-the money call option may only cost a few dollars, compared the price of a $100 stock. It is this use of options that is part of the reason options have the reputation for being risky. This is because when you buy an option, you have to be correct in determining not only the direction of the stock's movement, but also the magnitude（幅度） and the timing of this movement. To succeed, you must correctly predict whether a stock will go up or down, and you have to be right about how much the price will change as well as the time frame it will take for all this to happen.

### Hedging

Options were invented not for speculation, but for the purpose of hedging. Hedging is a strategy that reduces risk at a reasonable cost. In this way, we can think of using options like an insurance policy. Just as you insure your house or car, options can be used to insure your investments against a downturn（下降）. Critics of options say that if you are so unsure of your stock pick that you need a hedge, you shouldn't make the investment. On the other hand, there is no doubt that hedging strategies can be useful, especially for large institutions. Even the individual investor can benefit. Imagine that you wanted to take advantage of technology stocks and their upside, but say you also wanted to limit any losses. By using options, you would be able to restrict your downside while enjoying the full upside in a cost-effective way. For short sellers, call options can be used in a similar way to restrict losses during a short squeeze, or in case of an incorrect short bet. (See also: Bill Ackman's Greatest Hits and Misses.)

### Spreading

Spreading is the use of two or more options positions. In effect, it combines having a market opinion (speculation) with limiting losses (hedging). Often times, spreading also limits potential upside as well, but these strategies can still be desirable（值得拥有的） since they are usually have a low implementation cost. Most spreads involving selling one option to buy another. Spreading is where the versatility of options is most apparent since a trader can construct a spread to profit from nearly any market outcome including markets that don’t move up or down. We will talk more about basic spreads later in this tutorial.

### Synthetics

A special type of spread is known as a “synthetic.” The purpose of this strategy is to create a position that behaves exactly like some other position without actually controlling that other asset. For example, if you buy an at-the-money call and simultaneously sell a put with the same expiration and strike, you will have created a synthetic long position in the underlying asset. Why not just buy the underlying asset? Perhaps you are restricted for some legal or regulatory reason from owning it, but are allowed to create a synthetic position, or if the underlying asset is something like an index that is difficult to construct from its individual components.

## How Options Work

Options contracts are essentially the price probabilities of future events. The more likely something is to occur, the more expensive an option would be that profits from that event. This is the key to understanding the relative value of options.

Let’s take as a generic example a call option on International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) with a strike price of $200; IBM is currently trading at $175 and expires in 3 months. Remember, the call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares of IBM at $200 at any point in the next 3 months. If the price of IBM rises above $200, then you “win.” It doesn’t matter that we don’t know the price of this option for the moment – what we can say for sure, though, is that the same option that expires not in 3 months but in 1 month will cost less because the chances of anything occurring within a shorter interval is smaller. Likewise, the same option that expires in a year will cost more. This is also why options experience time decay（时间衰减）: the same option will be worth less tomorrow than today if the price of the stock doesn’t move.

Returning to our 3-month expiration, another factor that will increase the likelihood that you’ll “win” is if the price of IBM stock rises closer to $200 – the closer the price of the stock to the strike, the more likely the event will happen. Thus, as the price of the underlying asset rises, the price of the call option premium will also rise. Alternatively, as the price goes down – and the gap between the strike price and the underlying asset prices widens – the option will cost less. Along a similar line, if the price of IBM stock stays at $175, the call with a $190 strike price will be worth more than the $200 strike call – since, again, the chances of the $190 event happening is greater than $200.

There is one other factor that can increase the odds（赔率） that the event we want to happen will occur – if the volatility（波动性，不稳定性） of the underlying asset increases. Something that has greater price swings – both up and down – will increase the chances of an event happening. Therefore, the greater the volatility, the greater the price of the option. Options trading and volatility are intrinsically linked to each other in this way.

With this in mind, let’s consider a hypothetical（假象的） example. Let's say that on May 1, the stock price of Cory's Tequila Co. (CTQ) is $67 and the premium (cost) is $3.15 for a July 70 Call, which indicates that the expiration is the third Friday of July and the strike price is $70. The total price of the contract is $3.15 x 100 = $315. In reality, you'd also have to take commissions（手续费） into account, but we'll ignore them for this example. On most U.S. exchanges, a stock option contract is the option to buy or sell 100 shares（一个合约至少包括100股，也即1手）; that's why you must multiply the contract by 100 to get the total price. The strike price of $70 means that the stock price must rise above $70 before the call option is worth anything; furthermore, because the contract is $3.15 per share, the break-even price（盈亏平衡点价格） would be $73.15.

Three weeks later the stock price is $78. The options contract has increased along with the stock price and is now worth $8.25 x 100 = $825. Subtract what you paid for the contract, and your profit is ($8.25 - $3.15) x 100 = $510. You almost doubled our money in just three weeks! You could sell your options, which is called "closing your position（平仓）," and take your profits – unless, of course, you think the stock price will continue to rise. For the sake of this example, let's say we let it ride.

By the expiration date, the price of CTQ drops down to $62. Because this is less than our $70 strike price and there is no time left, the option contract is worthless. We are now down by the original premium cost of $315.

To recap, here is what happened to our option investment:

So far we've talked about options as the right to buy or sell (exercise) the underlying good. This is true, but in reality, a majority of options are not actually exercised. In our example, you could make money by exercising at $70 and then selling the stock back in the market at $78 for a profit of $8 a share. You could also keep the stock, knowing you were able to buy it at a discount to the present value. However, the majority of the time holders choose to take their profits by trading out (closing out) their position. This means that holders sell their options in the market, and writers buy their positions back to close. According to the CBOE​, only about 10% of options are exercised, 60% are traded (closed) out, and 30% expire worthless.

At this point it is worth explaining more about the pricing of options. In our example the premium (price) of the option went from $3.15 to $8.25. These fluctuations（波动） can be explained by intrinsic value and extrinsic value, also known as time value. An option's premium is the combination of its intrinsic value and its time value. Intrinsic value is the amount in-the-money, which, for a call option, means that the price of the stock equals the strike price. Time value represents the possibility of the option increasing in value. Refer back to the beginning of this section of the turorial: the more likely an event is to occur, the more expensive the option. This is the extrinsic, or time value. So, the price of the option in our example can be thought of as the following:

```
Premium =	Intrinsic Value +	Time Value
$8.25 =	$8 +	$0.25
```

In real life options almost always trade at some level above their intrinsic value, because the probability of an event occurring is never absolutely zero, even if it is highly unlikely. If you are wondering, we just picked the numbers for this example out of the air to demonstrate how options work.

A brief word on options pricing. As we’ve seen, the relative price of an option has to do with the chances that an event will happen. But in order to put an absolute price on an option, a pricing model must be used. The most well-known model is the Black-Scholes-Merton​ model, which was derived in the 1970’s, and for which the Nobel prize in economics was awarded. Since then other models have emerged such as binomial and trinomial tree models, which are also commonly used.

## Types Of Options

We’ve already talked about the differences between calls and puts, but there exist some other ways of categorizing options contracts. American options can be exercised at any time between the date of purchase and the expiration date. The example about Cory's Tequila Co. is an example of the use of an American option. Most exchange-traded options are of this type. European options are different from American options in that they can only be exercised at the end of their lives on their expiration date. The distinction between American and European options has nothing to do with geographic location, only with early-exercise. Most options on stock indices are of the European type. Because the right to exercise early has some value, an American option typically carries a higher premium than an otherwise identical European option.

### American and European Options

Options can also be categorized by their duration until expiration. Short-term options are those that expire generally in a year or less. Long-term options with expirations greater than a year are classified as long-term equity anticipation securities, or LEAPs. By providing opportunities to control and manage risk or even to speculate, LEAPS are virtually identical to regular options. LEAPS, however, provide these opportunities for much longer periods of time. Although they are not available on all stocks, LEAPS are available on most widely held issues.

Options can also be distinguished by when their expiration date falls. Traditionally, listed options have expired on the third Friday of the month. However due to increased demand, sets of options now expire weekly on each Friday, at the end of the month or even on a daily basis.

### Options Exchanges

Options traded on exchanges are called listed options. In the U.S. there are a number of exchanges, both physical and electronic, where options are traded. Options can also be traded directly between counterparties​ with the use of an exchange; these are known as over-the-counter (OTC) options. Many times, financial institutions will use OTC options to tailor specific outcome events that are not available among listed options. In order to provide liquidity to options markets, there exist market makers who are required to “make” a two-sided market in an option if asked to quote. Market makers, using theoretical pricing models, can take advantage of arbitrage（套利） and theoretical mispricings between the options’ perceived value and its market price.

The simple calls and puts we've discussed are sometimes referred to as plain vanilla options. Even though the subject of options can be difficult to understand at first, these plain vanilla options are as easy as it gets. Because of the versatility of options, there are many other types and variations of options. Non-standard options are called exotic options, which are either variations on the payoff profiles of the plain vanilla options or are wholly different products with "option-ality" embedded in them. For example, so-called binary options have a simple payoff structure that is determined if the payoff event happens and doesn’t care about the degree. Other types of exotic options include break-out, break-in, barrier options, lookback options, Asian options and Bermudan options.

## Options Basics: How To Read An Options Table

As more and more traders have learned of the multitude of potential benefits available to them via the use of options, the trading volume in options has proliferated（激增） over the years. This trend has also been driven by the advent of electronic trading and data dissemination（传播）. Some traders use options to speculate on price direction, others to hedge existing or anticipated positions and others still to craft unique positions that offer benefits not routinely available to the trader of just the underlying stock, index or futures contract (for example, the ability to make money if the underlying security remains relatively unchanged). Regardless of their objective, one of the keys to success is to pick the right option, or combination of options, needed to create a position with the desired risk-to-reward tradeoff(s). As such, today's savvy option trader is typically looking at a more sophisticated set of data when it comes to options than the traders of decades past.

The Old Days of Option Price Reporting

In "the old days" some newspapers used to list rows and rows of nearly indecipherable（难懂的） option price data deep within its financial section such as that displayed in Figure 1.

Investor's Business Daily and the Wall Street Journal still include a partial listing of option data for many of the more active optionable stocks. The old newspaper listings included mostly just the basics – a "P" or a "C" to indicate if the option a call or a put, the strike price, the last trade price for the option, and in some cases, volume and open interest figures. And while this was all well and good, many of today's option traders have a greater understanding of the variables that drive option trades. Among these variables are a number of "Greek" values derived from an option pricing model, implied option volatility and the all important bid/ask spread. (Learn more in Using the Greeks to Understand Options.)

As a result, more and more traders are finding option data via on-line sources. While each source has its own format for presenting the data, the key variables generally include those listed in Figure 2. The option listing shown in Figure 2 is from Optionetics Platinum software. The variables listed are the ones most looked at by today's better educated option trader.

The data provided in Figure 2 provides the following information:

Column 1 – OpSym: this field designates the underlying stock symbol (IBM), the contract month and year (MAR10 means March of 2010), the strike price (110, 115, 120, etc.) and whether it is a call or a put option (a C or a P).

Column 2 – Bid (pts): The "bid" price is the latest price offered by a market maker to buy a particular option. What this means is that if you enter a "market order" to sell the March 2010, 125 call, you would sell it at the bid price of $3.40.

Column 3 – Ask (pts): The "ask" price is the latest price offered by a market maker to sell a particular option. What this means is that if you enter a "market order" to buy the March 2010, 125 call, you would buy it at the ask price of $3.50.

NOTE: Buying at the bid and selling at the ask is how market makers make their living. It is imperative for an option trader to consider the difference between the bid and ask price when considering any option trade. The more active the option, typically the tighter the bid/ask spread. A wide spread can be problematic for any trader, especially a short-term trader. If the bid is $3.40 and the ask is $3.50, the implication is that if you bought the option one moment (at $3.50 ask) and turned around and sold it an instant later (at $3.40 bid), even though the price of the option did not change, you would lose -2.85% on the trade ((3.40-3.50)/3.50).

Column 4 – Extrinsic Bid/Ask (pts): This column displays the amount of time premium built into the price of each option (in this example there are two prices, one based on the bid price and the other on the ask price). This is important to note because all options lose all of their time premium by the time of option expiration. So this value reflects the entire amount of time premium presently built into the price of the option.

Column 5 – Implied Volatility (IV) Bid/Ask (%): This value is calculated by an option pricing model such as the Black-Scholes model, and represents the level of expected future volatility based on the current price of the option and other known option pricing variables (including the amount of time until expiration, the difference between the strike price and the actual stock price and a risk-free interest rate). The higher the IV Bid/Ask (%)the more time premium is built into the price of the option and vice versa. If you have access to the historical range of IV values for the security in question you can determine if the current level of extrinsic value is presently on the high end (good for writing options) or low end (good for buying options).

Column 6 – Delta Bid/Ask (%): Delta is a Greek value derived from an option pricing model and which represents the "stock equivalent position" for an option. The delta for a call option can range from 0 to 100 (and for a put option from 0 to -100). The present reward/risk characteristics associated with holding a call option with a delta of 50 is essentially the same as holding 50 shares of stock. If the stock goes up one full point, the option will gain roughly one half a point. The further an option is in-the-money, the more the position acts like a stock position. In other words, as delta approaches 100 the option trades more and more like the underlying stock i.e., an option with a delta of 100 would gain or lose one full point for each one dollar gain or loss in the underlying stock price. (For more check out Using the Greeks to Understand Options.)

Column 7 – Gamma Bid/Ask (%): Gamma is another Greek value derived from an option pricing model. Gamma tells you how many deltas the option will gain or lose if the underlying stock rises by one full point. So for example, if we bought the March 2010 125 call at $3.50, we would have a delta of 58.20. In other words, if IBM stock rises by a dollar this option should gain roughly $0.5820 in value. In addition, if the stock rises in price today by one full point this option will gain 5.65 deltas (the current gamma value) and would then have a delta of 63.85. From there another one point gain in the price of the stock would result in a price gain for the option of roughly $0.6385.

Column 8 – Vega Bid/Ask (pts/% IV): Vega is a Greek value that indicates the amount by which the price of the option would be expected to rise or fall based solely on a one point increase in implied volatility. So looking once again at the March 2010 125 call, if implied volatility rose one point – from 19.04% to 20.04%, the price of this option would gain $0.141. This indicates why it is preferable to buy options when implied volatility is low (you pay relatively less time premium and a subsequent rise in IV will inflate the price of the option) and to write options when implied volatility is high (as more premium is available and a subsequent decline in IV will deflate the price of the option).

Column 9 – Theta Bid/Ask (pts/day): As was noted in the extrinsic value column, all options lose all time premium by expiration. In addition, "time decay" as it is known, accelerates as expiration draws closer. Theta is the Greek value that indicates how much value an option will lose with the passage of one day's time. At present, the March 2010 125 Call will lose $0.0431 of value due solely to the passage of one day's time, even if the option and all other Greek values are otherwise unchanged.

Column 10 – Volume: This simply tells you how many contracts of a particular option were traded during the latest session. Typically – though not always - options with large volume will have relatively tighter bid/ask spreads as the competition to buy and sell these options is great.

Column 11 – Open Interest: This value indicates the total number of contracts of a particular option that have been opened but have not yet been offset.

Column 12 – Strike: The "strike price" for the option in question. This is the price that the buyer of that option can purchase the underlying security at if he chooses to exercise his option. It is also the price at which the writer of the option must sell the underlying security if the option is exercised against him.

A table for the respective put options would similar, with two primary differences:

* Call options are more expensive the lower the strike price, put options are more expensive the higher the strike price. With calls, the lower strike prices have the highest option prices, with option prices declining at each higher strike level. This is because each successive strike price is either less in-the-money or more out-of-the-money, thus each contains less "intrinsic value" than the option at the next lower strike price.

* With puts, it is just the opposite. As the strike prices go higher, put options become either less-out-of-the-money or more in-the-money and thus accrete more intrinsic value. Thus with puts the option prices are greater as the strike prices rise.

For call options, the delta values are positive and are higher at lower strike price. For put options, the delta values are negative and are higher at higher strike price. The negative values for put options derive from the fact that they represent a stock equivalent position. Buying a put option is similar to entering a short position in a stock, hence the negative delta value.

Option trading and the sophistication level of the average option trader have come a long way since option trading began decades ago. Today's option quote screen reflects these advances.

## Options Basics: Options Spreads

Options spreading is one common use of these securities and involves buying and selling options at the same time (spreading) or buying combinations of options. In this section, we will provide a very basic overview of the most common options spreads and combinations.

### Long Calls and Puts

The simplest options position is a long call (or put) by itself. This position profits if the price of the underlying rises and your downside is limited to the option premium if it does not. If you simultaneously buy a put option with the same strike and expiration, you’ve created a straddle. This position pays off if the underlying price rises or falls; however if the price remains relatively stable, you lose both the call and the put premiums. A similar strategy is to buy a call and then also buy a put with a lower strike, known as a strangle. A strangle requires larger price moves either way to profit, but is also less expensive than a straddle. On the other hand, being short either a straddle or a strangle (selling both options) would profit from a market that doesn’t move very much.

Options spreading is one common use of these securities and involves buying and selling options at the same time (spreading) or buying combinations of options. In this section, we will provide a very basic overview of the most common options spreads and combinations.

Long Calls and Puts
The simplest options position is a long call (or put) by itself. This position profits if the price of the underlying rises and your downside is limited to the option premium if it does not. If you simultaneously buy a put option with the same strike and expiration, you’ve created a straddle. This position pays off if the underlying price rises or falls; however if the price remains relatively stable, you lose both the call and the put premiums. A similar strategy is to buy a call and then also buy a put with a lower strike, known as a strangle. A strangle requires larger price moves either way to profit, but is also less expensive than a straddle. On the other hand, being short either a straddle or a strangle (selling both options) would profit from a market that doesn’t move very much.

Spreads Bulls and Butterflies
A call spread or bull vertical spread is created by buying a call and simultaneously selling another call with a higher strike price. The spread is profitable if the underlying asset increases in price, but this upside is limited by virtue of the short call. The benefit, however, is that selling the call reduces the cost of buying the other one. Similarly, a put spread or bear vertical spread involves buying a put and selling a second put with a lower strike. If you buy and sell options with different expirations it is known as a calendar spread or time spread.

A butterfly consists of options at three strikes, equally spaced apart, where all options are of the same type (either all calls or all puts) and have the same expiration. In a long butterfly, the middle strike option is sold and the outside strikes are bought in a ratio of 1:2:1 (buy one, sell two, buy one). If this ratio does not hold, it is not a butterfly. The outside strikes are commonly referred to as the wings of the butterfly, and the inside strike as the body. The value of a butterfly can never fall below zero. An example of a butterfly would be to go long a 70 call, short two 75 calls, and long an 80 call. The identical spread could also be made with long the 70 put, short two 75 puts, and long an 80 put. Being long a butterfly profits from a quiet market. Similar to a butterfly are the condor, iron butterfly, and iron condor.

We addressed briefly how a synthetic position in the underlying can be created from options. Combining options positions with the underlying can also produce synthetic options. This has to do with what is known as put-call parity where

    Call Price – Put Price = Underlying Price – Strike Price.

Rearranging this equation we can create a synthetic long call for a given strike price by buying a put and also buying the underlying. A synthetic put is likewise a long call combined with going short the underlying. Combining spreads with a trade in the underlying can also create novel positions such as the collar, fence, or risk reversal, all names for the same strategy: selling an upside call, buying a downside put, and buying the underlying.

## Options Risks

Because options prices can be modeled mathematically with a model such as Black-Scholes, many of the risks associated with options can also be modeled and understood. This particular feature of options actually makes them arguable less risky than other asset classes, or at least allows the risks associated with options to be understood and evaluated. Individual risks have been assigned Greek letter names, and are sometimes referred to simply as the greeks.

### Meet the Greeks

Delta is the change in option price per unit (point) change in the underlying price and thus represents the directional risk. Delta is interpreted as the hedge ratio, or alternatively the equivalent position in the underlying security: a 4000 delta position is equivalent to long 4000 shares.

The delta can represent the probability an option has at finishing in the money (a 40-delta option has a 40% chance of finishing in the money). At-the-money options always have a 50 delta. In-the-money options have a delta greater than 50, and out-of-the-money options less than 50. Increasing volatility or time to expiration causes deltas to tend to 50.

Gamma is the change in delta per unit (point) change in the underlying security. The gamma shows how fast the delta will move if the underlying security moves a point. This is an important value to watch, since it tells you how much greater your directional risk increases as the underlying moves. Options at the money have the largest gammas and those close to expiration also have the largest gammas. Lowering volatility raises the gamma.

Theta is the change in option price per unit (day) change in time. Also known as time decay risk, it represents how much value an option loses as time passes. Long-term options decay at a slower rate than near-term options. The theta is opposite in sign to the gamma and can represent the trade-off between time passing and the underlying security moving. Options near expiration have the highest theta. At the money options also have the greatest theta. As volatility is increased, the theta will also increase.

Vega is the risk to volatility risk, or the change in option price per unit (percent) change in volatility. If an option has a 2 vega and the vol. Goes up 1%, the option value increases by $2. Out of the money options have the largest vega as a percent of option value. Long-term options also have the highest vegas. At the money options have fairly stable vega’s with respect to changes in volatility.

Rho is the interest rate risk: the change in option price per unit change in interest rates. A position with positive Rho will be helped by an increase in interest rates and a negative rho will be helped by a decrease in interest rates.


## Conclusion

We hope this tutorial has given you some insight into the world of options. Once again, we must emphasize that options aren't for all investors. Options are sophisticated trading tools that can be dangerous if you don't educate yourself before using them. Please use this tutorial as it was intended – as a starting point to learning more about options.

Let's recap:

- An option is a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.
- Options are derivatives because they derive their value from an underlying asset.
- A call gives the holder the right to buy an asset at a certain price within a specific period of time.
- A put gives the holder the right to sell an asset at a certain price within a specific period of time.
- There are four types of participants in options markets: buyers of calls, sellers of calls, buyers of puts, and sellers of puts.
- Buyers are often referred to as holders and sellers are also referred to as writers.
- The price at which an underlying stock can be purchased or sold is called the strike price.
- The total cost of an option is called the premium, which is determined by factors including the stock price, strike price and time remaining until expiration.
- The premium of an option increases as the chances of the event of the option finishing in-the-money increases.
- A stock option contract typically represents 100 shares of the underlying stock.
- Investors use options both to speculate and hedge risk.
- Spreads and synthetic positions highlight the versatility of options contracts
- Employee stock options are different from listed options because they are a contract between the company and the holder. (Employee stock options do not involve any third parties.)
- The two main classifications of options are American and European. Options can also be distinguished as listed/OTC, or vanilla/exotic, among other classification schemes.
- Long term options are known as LEAPS.
- Options risks are defined by the greeks and allows options risks to be understood and evaluated.-
