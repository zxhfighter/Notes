# Options Basics Tutorial

[TOC]

## introduction

Nowadays, many investors' portfolios（投资组合） include investments such as mutual funds（共同基金，美国的一种投资方式）, stocks and bonds（债权）. But the variety of securities（证券，包括股票、债权、期权等） you have at your disposal（任你自由支配） does not end there. Another type of security, known as options, presents a world of opportunity to sophisticated investors who understand both the practical uses and inherent risks（固有风险） associated with this asset class.

The power of options lies in their versatility（多用途）, and their ability to interact with traditional assets such as individual stocks. They enable you to adapt or adjust your position（仓位） according to many market situations that may arise. For example, options can be used as an effective hedge（对冲） against a declining stock market to limit downside losses. Options can be put to use for speculative（投机的） purposes or to be exceedingly conservative（保守）, as you want. Using options is therefore best described as part of a larger strategy of investing.

This functional vzu'll often come across a disclaimer（声明） like the following:

Options involve risks and are not suitable for everyone. Option trading can be speculative（投机的） in nature and carry substantial（可观的） risk of loss. Only invest with risk capital（风险资本）.

Options belong to the larger group of securities known as derivatives（衍生品）. This word has come to be associated with excessive risk taking and having the ability crash economies. That perception（看法）, however, is broadly overblown（浮夸的）. All “derivative” means is that its price is dependent on, or derived from the price of something else. Put this way, wine is a derivative of grapes; ketchup（番茄酱） is a derivative of tomatoes. Options are derivatives of financial securities – their value depends on the price of some other asset. That is all derivative means, and there are many different types of securities that fall under the name derivatives, including futures（期货）, forwards（远期合约）, swaps（互换） (of which there are many types), and mortgage（抵押贷款） backed securities. In the 2008 crisis, it was mortgage backed securities and a particular type of swap that caused trouble. Options were largely blameless（无可指责的）. (See also: 10 Options Strategies To Know.)

Properly knowing how options work, and how to use them appropriately can give you a real advantage in the market. If the speculative nature of options doesn't fit your style, no problem – you can use options without speculating. Even if you decide never to use options, however, it is important to understand how companies that you are investing in use them. Whether it is to hedge the risk of foreign-exchange transactions or to give employees ownership in the form of stock options, most multi-nationals（跨国公司） today use options in some form or another.

This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamentals of options. Keep in mind that most options traders have many years of experience, so don't expect to be an expert immediately after reading this tutorial. If you aren't familiar with how the stock market works, you might want to check out the Stock Basics tutorial first.

## What Are Options

Options are a type of derivative security（证券衍生品）. They are a derivative because the price of an option is intrinsically（本质的、内在的） linked to the price of something else. Specifically, options are contracts that grant the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset（底层标的） at a set price on or before a certain date. The right to buy is called a call option and the right to sell is a put option. People somewhat familiar with derivatives may not see an obvious difference between this definition and what a future（期货） or forward contract（远期合约） does. The answer is that futures or forwards confer（赋予） both the right and obligation to buy or sell at some point in the future. For example, somebody short a futures contract for cattle（牛） is obliged（有义务） to deliver physical cows to a buyer unless they close out their positions（清仓） before expiration. An options contract does not carry the same obligation, which is precisely why it is called an “option.”（也就是说，期权赋予了你在某个时间购买或者卖空某个标的物的权力，但是你可以选择不执行，即没有义务一定要执行这个权力）

### Call and Put Options

A call option might be thought of as a deposit（储蓄、存款） for a future purpose. For example, a land developer may want the right to purchase a vacant lot（空地） in the future, but will only want to exercise that right if certain zoning（分区） laws are put into place. The developer can buy a call option from the landowner to buy the lot at say $250,000 at any point in the next 3 years. Of course, the landowner will not grant such an option for free, the developer needs to contribute a down payment to lock in that right. With respect to options, this cost is known as the premium（保证金）, and is the price of the options contract. In this example, the premium might be $6,000 that the developer pays the landowner. Two years have passed, and now the zoning has been approved; the developer exercises his option and buys the land for $250,000 – even though the market value of that plot has doubled. In an alternative scenario, the zoning approval doesn’t come through until year 4, one year past the expiration of this option. Now the developer must pay market price. In either case, the landowner keeps the $6,000.

A put option, on the other hand, might be thought of as an insurance policy（保险策略）. Our land developer owns a large portfolio（投资组合） of blue chip stocks（蓝筹股） and is worried that there might be a recession（经济衰退） within the next two years. He wants to be sure that if a bear market hits, his portfolio won’t lose more than 10% of its value. If the S&P 500 is currently trading at 2500, he can purchase a put option giving him the right to sell the index at 2250 at any point in the next two years. If in six months time the market crashes by 20%, 500 points in his portfolio, he has made 250 points by being able to sell the index at 2250 when it is trading at 2000 – a combined loss of just 10%. In fact, even if the market drops to zero, he will still only lose 10% given his put option. Again, purchasing the option will carry a cost (its premium) and if the market doesn’t drop during that period the premium is lost.

These examples demonstrate a couple of very important points. First, when you buy an option, you have a right but not an obligation（责任、义务） to do something with it. You can always let the expiration date（行权日） go by, at which point the option becomes worthless. If this happens, however, you lose 100% of your investment, which is the money you used to pay for the option premium. Second, an option is merely a contract that deals with an underlying asset. For this reason, options are derivatives. In this tutorial, the underlying asset will typically be a stock or stock index, but options are actively traded on all sorts of financial securities such as bonds（债权）, foreign currencies（外汇）, commodities（商品）, and even other derivatives.

### Buying and Selling Calls and Puts: Four Cardinal Coordinates（卡迪尔坐标）

Owning a call option gives you a long position in the market, and therefore the seller of a call option is a short position. Owning a put option gives you a short position in the market, and selling a put is a long position. Keeping these four straight is crucial as they relate to the four things you can do with options: buy calls; sell calls; buy puts; and sell puts.

People who buy options are called holders and those who sell options are called writers of options. Here is the important distinction between buyers and sellers:

Call holders and put holders (buyers) are not obligated to buy or sell. They have the choice to exercise their rights if they choose. This limits the risk of buyers of options, so that the most they can ever lose is the premium of their options.

Call writers and put writers (sellers), however, are obligated to buy or sell. This means that a seller may be required to make good on a promise to buy or sell. It also implies that option sellers have unlimited risk, meaning that they can lose much more than the price of the options premium.

Don't worry if this seems confusing – it is. For this reason we are going to look at options primarily from the point of view of the buyer. At this point, it is sufficient to understand that there are two sides of an options contract.

### Options Terminology

To understand options, you'll also have to first know the terminology associated with the options market.

The price at which an underlying stock can be purchased or sold is called the strike price（行权价）. This is the price a stock price must go above (for calls) or go below (for puts) before a position can be exercised for a profit. All of this must occur before the expiration date. In our example above, the strike price for the S&P 500 put option was 2250.

The expiration date（行权日）, or expiry of an option is the exact date that the contract terminates.

An option that is traded on a national options exchange such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is known as a listed option. These have fixed strike prices and expiration dates. Each listed option represents 100 shares of company stock (known as a contract).

For call options, the option is said to be in-the-money（价内期权，股价高于行权价） if the share price is above the strike price. A put option is in-the-money when the share price is below the strike price. The amount by which an option is in-the-money is referred to as intrinsic value（内在价值）. An option is out-of-the-money（价外期权，股价低于行权价） if the price of the underlying remains below the strike price (for a call), or above the strike price (for a put). An option is at-the-money（等价期权） when the price of the underlying is on or very close to the strike price.

As mentioned above, the total cost (the price) of an option is called the premium. This price is determined by factors including the stock price（股价）, strike price（行权价）, time remaining（剩余时间） until expiration (time value) and volatility（波动率）. Because of all these factors, determining the premium of an option is complicated and largely beyond the scope of this tutorial, although we will discuss it briefly.

Although employee stock options aren't available for just anyone to trade, this type of option could, in a way, be classified as a type of call option. Many companies use stock options as a way to attract and to keep talented employees, especially management. They are similar to regular stock options in that the holder has the right but not the obligation to purchase company stock. The contract, however, exists only between the holder and the company and cannot typically be exchanged with anybody else, whereas a normal option is a contract between two parties that are completely unrelated to the company and can be traded freely.


## Why Use Options?

There are a number of reasons an investor would use options. These include speculation（投机）, hedging（对冲）, spreading（分散投资）, and creating synthetic positions（合成仓位）. There are other less common uses for options that won’t be discussed here.

### Speculation

Speculation is making a bet on the outcome of the future price of something. A speculator might think the price of a stock will go up, perhaps based on a gut feeling（直觉） and hopes to make a short term profit by selling that stock at a higher price. Speculating in this way with a call option – instead of buying the stock outright（直接的） – is attractive to some traders since options provide leverage（杠杆）. An out-of-the money call option may only cost a few dollars, compared the price of a $100 stock. It is this use of options that is part of the reason options have the reputation for being risky. This is because when you buy an option, you have to be correct in determining not only the direction of the stock's movement, but also the magnitude（幅度） and the timing of this movement. To succeed, you must correctly predict whether a stock will go up or down, and you have to be right about how much the price will change as well as the time frame it will take for all this to happen.

### Hedging

Options were invented not for speculation, but for the purpose of hedging. Hedging is a strategy that reduces risk at a reasonable cost. In this way, we can think of using options like an insurance policy. Just as you insure your house or car, options can be used to insure your investments against a downturn（下降）. Critics of options say that if you are so unsure of your stock pick that you need a hedge, you shouldn't make the investment. On the other hand, there is no doubt that hedging strategies can be useful, especially for large institutions. Even the individual investor can benefit. Imagine that you wanted to take advantage of technology stocks and their upside, but say you also wanted to limit any losses. By using options, you would be able to restrict your downside while enjoying the full upside in a cost-effective way. For short sellers, call options can be used in a similar way to restrict losses during a short squeeze, or in case of an incorrect short bet. (See also: Bill Ackman's Greatest Hits and Misses.)

### Spreading

Spreading is the use of two or more options positions. In effect, it combines having a market opinion (speculation) with limiting losses (hedging). Often times, spreading also limits potential upside as well, but these strategies can still be desirable（值得拥有的） since they are usually have a low implementation cost. Most spreads involving selling one option to buy another. Spreading is where the versatility of options is most apparent since a trader can construct a spread to profit from nearly any market outcome including markets that don’t move up or down. We will talk more about basic spreads later in this tutorial.

### Synthetics

A special type of spread is known as a “synthetic.” The purpose of this strategy is to create a position that behaves exactly like some other position without actually controlling that other asset. For example, if you buy an at-the-money call and simultaneously sell a put with the same expiration and strike, you will have created a synthetic long position in the underlying asset. Why not just buy the underlying asset? Perhaps you are restricted for some legal or regulatory reason from owning it, but are allowed to create a synthetic position, or if the underlying asset is something like an index that is difficult to construct from its individual components.

## How Options Work

Options contracts are essentially the price probabilities of future events. The more likely something is to occur, the more expensive an option would be that profits from that event. This is the key to understanding the relative value of options.

Let’s take as a generic example a call option on International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) with a strike price of $200; IBM is currently trading at $175 and expires in 3 months. Remember, the call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares of IBM at $200 at any point in the next 3 months. If the price of IBM rises above $200, then you “win.” It doesn’t matter that we don’t know the price of this option for the moment – what we can say for sure, though, is that the same option that expires not in 3 months but in 1 month will cost less because the chances of anything occurring within a shorter interval is smaller. Likewise, the same option that expires in a year will cost more. This is also why options experience time decay（时间衰减）: the same option will be worth less tomorrow than today if the price of the stock doesn’t move.

Returning to our 3-month expiration, another factor that will increase the likelihood that you’ll “win” is if the price of IBM stock rises closer to $200 – the closer the price of the stock to the strike, the more likely the event will happen. Thus, as the price of the underlying asset rises, the price of the call option premium will also rise. Alternatively, as the price goes down – and the gap between the strike price and the underlying asset prices widens – the option will cost less. Along a similar line, if the price of IBM stock stays at $175, the call with a $190 strike price will be worth more than the $200 strike call – since, again, the chances of the $190 event happening is greater than $200.

There is one other factor that can increase the odds（赔率） that the event we want to happen will occur – if the volatility（波动性，不稳定性） of the underlying asset increases. Something that has greater price swings – both up and down – will increase the chances of an event happening. Therefore, the greater the volatility, the greater the price of the option. Options trading and volatility are intrinsically linked to each other in this way.

With this in mind, let’s consider a hypothetical（假象的） example. Let's say that on May 1, the stock price of Cory's Tequila Co. (CTQ) is $67 and the premium (cost) is $3.15 for a July 70 Call, which indicates that the expiration is the third Friday of July and the strike price is $70. The total price of the contract is $3.15 x 100 = $315. In reality, you'd also have to take commissions（手续费） into account, but we'll ignore them for this example. On most U.S. exchanges, a stock option contract is the option to buy or sell 100 shares（一个合约至少包括100股，也即1手）; that's why you must multiply the contract by 100 to get the total price. The strike price of $70 means that the stock price must rise above $70 before the call option is worth anything; furthermore, because the contract is $3.15 per share, the break-even price（盈亏平衡点价格） would be $73.15.

Three weeks later the stock price is $78. The options contract has increased along with the stock price and is now worth $8.25 x 100 = $825. Subtract what you paid for the contract, and your profit is ($8.25 - $3.15) x 100 = $510. You almost doubled our money in just three weeks! You could sell your options, which is called "closing your position（平仓）," and take your profits – unless, of course, you think the stock price will continue to rise. For the sake of this example, let's say we let it ride.

By the expiration date, the price of CTQ drops down to $62. Because this is less than our $70 strike price and there is no time left, the option contract is worthless. We are now down by the original premium cost of $315.

To recap, here is what happened to our option investment:

So far we've talked about options as the right to buy or sell (exercise) the underlying good. This is true, but in reality, a majority of options are not actually exercised. In our example, you could make money by exercising at $70 and then selling the stock back in the market at $78 for a profit of $8 a share. You could also keep the stock, knowing you were able to buy it at a discount to the present value. However, the majority of the time holders choose to take their profits by trading out (closing out) their position. This means that holders sell their options in the market, and writers buy their positions back to close. According to the CBOE​, only about 10% of options are exercised, 60% are traded (closed) out, and 30% expire worthless.

At this point it is worth explaining more about the pricing of options. In our example the premium (price) of the option went from $3.15 to $8.25. These fluctuations（波动） can be explained by intrinsic value and extrinsic value, also known as time value. An option's premium is the combination of its intrinsic value and its time value. Intrinsic value is the amount in-the-money, which, for a call option, means that the price of the stock equals the strike price. Time value represents the possibility of the option increasing in value. Refer back to the beginning of this section of the turorial: the more likely an event is to occur, the more expensive the option. This is the extrinsic, or time value. So, the price of the option in our example can be thought of as the following:

```
Premium =	Intrinsic Value +	Time Value
$8.25 =	$8 +	$0.25
```

In real life options almost always trade at some level above their intrinsic value, because the probability of an event occurring is never absolutely zero, even if it is highly unlikely. If you are wondering, we just picked the numbers for this example out of the air to demonstrate how options work.

A brief word on options pricing. As we’ve seen, the relative price of an option has to do with the chances that an event will happen. But in order to put an absolute price on an option, a pricing model must be used. The most well-known model is the Black-Scholes-Merton​ model, which was derived in the 1970’s, and for which the Nobel prize in economics was awarded. Since then other models have emerged such as binomial and trinomial tree models, which are also commonly used.
