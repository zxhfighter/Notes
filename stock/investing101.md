# Investing 101: A Tutorial For Beginner Investors

[TOC]

Investing is a tool for building wealth, but it is not only for the wealthy. Anyone can get started on an investing program, and various vehicles make it easy to begin with small amounts and add to a portfolio periodically. In fact, what differentiates investing from gambling is that it takes time—it is not a get-rich-quick(快速致富) scheme.

This tutorial will help you to understand what investing is, what it means and how the “miracle” of compounding(复利) works. It will also cover some of the building blocks of the investing world and the markets and provide some insights into techniques with the goal of helping you think about which investing strategies and vehicles are right for you.

When you are finished with Investing 101, you can continue your financial education with some of our specialized tutorials such as the Stock Basics or Mutual Fund Basics. You can also visit Investopedia's Advisor Insights section to ask one of our participating financial advisors any specific questions.

## What Is Investing?

Investing: The act of committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett defines investing as “… the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future.” The goal of investing is to put your money to work in one or more types of investment vehicles in the hopes of growing your money over time.

What is investing?

Investing is really about “working smarter and not harder.” Most of us work hard at our jobs, whether for a company or our own business. We often work long hours, which requires sacrifice and adds stress. Taking some of our hard-earned money and investing for our future needs is a way to make the most of what we earn.

Investing is also about making priorities for your money. Spending is easy and gives instant gratification(满足感)—whether the splurge(挥霍，花钱) is on a new outfit(衣服), a vacation to some exotic(异国情调) spot or dinner in a fancy restaurant. All of these are wonderful and make life more enjoyable. But investing requires prioritizing our financial futures over our present desires.

Investing is a way to set aside money while you are busy with life and have that money work for you so that you can fully reap the rewards of your labor in the future. Investing is a means to a happier ending.

Investing Vehicles

There are many different ways you can go about investing, including putting money into stocks, bonds, mutual funds(共同基金), ETFs, real estate (and other alternative investment vehicles), or even starting your own business.

Every investment vehicle has its positives and negatives, which we'll discuss in a later section of this tutorial. Understanding how different types of investment vehicles work is critical to your success. For example, what does a mutual fund invest in? Who is managing the fund? What are the fees and expenses? Are there any costs or penalties for accessing your money? These are all questions that should be answered before making an investment. While it is true there are no guarantees of making money, some work on your part can increase your odds of being a successful investor. Analysis, research and even just reading up on investing can all help.

Now that you have a general idea of what investing is and why you should do it, it's time to learn about how investing lets you take advantage of one of the miracles of mathematics: compound interest.

## The Concept Of Compounding

Compounding is the process of generating more return on an asset's reinvested earnings. To work, it requires two things: the reinvestment of earnings and time. Compound interest can help your initial investment grow exponentially. For younger investors, it is the greatest investing tool possible, and the #1 argument for starting as early as possible. Below we give a couple of examples of compound interest.

Example #1: Apple stock

An investment of $10,000 in the stock of Apple (AAPL) that was made on December 31, 1980 would have grown to $2,709,248 as of the market’s close on February 28, 2017 according to Morningstar’s Advisor Workstation tool. This translates to an annual return of 16.75%, including the reinvestment of all dividends from the stock.

Apple started paying dividends in 2012. Even so, if those dividends hadn’t been reinvested the ending balance of this investment would have been $2,247,949 or 83% of the amount that you would have had by reinvesting.

While Apple of one of the most successful companies, and their stock is a winner year-in and year-out, compound interest also works for index funds, which which are managed to replicate the performance of a major market index such as the S&P 500.

Example #2: Vanguard 500 Index

Another example of the benefits of compounding is the popular Vanguard 500 Index fund (VFINX) held for the 20 years ending February 28, 2017.

A $10,000 investment into the fund made on February 28, 1997 would have grown to a value of $42,650 at the end of the 20-year period. This assumes the reinvestment of all fund distributions for dividends, interest or capital gains back into the fund.

Without reinvesting the distributions, the value of the initial $10,000 investment would have grown to $29,548 or 69% of the amount with reinvestment.

In this and the Apple example, current year taxes would have been due on any fund distributions or stock dividends if the investment was held in a taxable account, but for most investors, these earnings can grow tax-deferred in a retirement account such as a employer-sponsored 401(k).

Starting Early

Another way to look at the power of compounding is to compare how much less initial investment you need if you start early to reach the same goal.

A 25-year-old who wishes to accumulate $1 million by age 60 would need to invest $880.21 each month assuming a constant return of 5%.

A 35-year-old wishing to accumulate $1 million by age 60 would need to invest $1,679.23 each month using the same assumptions.

A 45-year-old would need to invest $3,741.27 each month to accumulate the same $1 million by age 60. That’s almost 4 times the amount that the 25-year old needs. Starting early is especially helpful when saving for retirement, when putting aside a little bit early in your career can reap great benefits.

## Knowing Yourself

No one investing strategy or approach fits all. Every investor has different reasons for investing, different goals, different time horizons and varying degrees of comfort with investing. It’s important to define and articulate your own parameters.

### Goals

What are your objectives for the money that you will be investing? Is safety of principal with some level of return sufficient? Are you trying to accumulate money for a longer-term goal such as a college education for your kids or perhaps a comfortable retirement for yourself?

You might even have different investments for different goals. The point is that before you decide to invest any money it is important to understand why you are investing and the end result that you are seeking.

Goals and objectives should not be created in a vacuum. You also need to know your risk tolerance and time horizon as part of the goal-setting process.

### Risk tolerance

Risk can mean a lot of things, but in the context of investing it means the risk of losing money. In other words, the risk that the amount of money invested will decrease in value, possibly to zero.

All investing involves risk in one way or another. Stocks can and often do go down in value over certain periods of time—in 2008, the S&P 500 dropped by 37%. While this decline in the stock market was one of the worst in history, less severe market corrections are not uncommon.

How much of a drop in value for your investments can you stomach? Your risk tolerance will likely be in part a function of when you need the money—known as your time horizon—which is usually a function of age. Someone in their 20s or 30s who is saving for retirement shouldn’t give too much thought to fluctuations in the value—known as the volatility—of their investments.

In contrast, someone in their 60s likely will and should have a lower risk tolerance if for no other reason than they don’t have the time to fully recoup a major loss in the value of their investments.

Your investments should be aligned with the time horizon in which you will need the money, especially if some or all of your investments are targeted for a specific goal.

For example, if you are young parents investing for your newborn’s college education, your long time horizon allows you to take a bit more risk in the initial years. When your kid gets to high school, you might adjust the investment mix to help ensure that you don’t suffer any major losses in the years leading up to the start of college.

### Trading Frequency

How long will you stay in one particular investment? Legendary investor Warren Buffett rarely sells a stock he owns and doesn’t get rattled by market fluctuations. This is generally known as a “buy-and-hold” strategy.

At the other extreme are traders who buy and sell stocks on a daily basis. This is fine for professionals, but rarely a good idea for the average investor.

Nobody is advocating that your need to hold an investment forever, and in fact things change and you should be reviewing your individual holdings periodically to ensure they are still appropriate for your situation.

### Knowledge and comfort

Some investment vehicles require sophisticated knowledge and monitoring, while others are more set-and-forget. Your investment decisions should be based on your comfort level and your willingness to devote time to researching your choices.

An easy route is to choose a variety of low-cost index funds that cover various parts of the markets such as bonds, domestic stocks and foreign stocks. Another alternative to consider are professionally managed vehicles such as target date mutual funds, where the manager allocates portfolio over time. These funds are designed to gradually reduce their exposure to equities as the target date of the fund gets closer

Investors with more knowledge and experience might consider actively managed mutual funds, individual stocks, real estate or other alternative investments.

### Understand what you don’t know

It is important that investors understand what they do and don’t know. They should never be talked into investing in something that they don’t understand or are uncomfortable with.
