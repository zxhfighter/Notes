## Stocks Basics: Introduction

Turn on the TV news or open a newspaper, surf the internet or listen to the radio, and you will probably come across some information about the stock market: “The Dow Jones closed at record highs”; “The S&P 500 is trading down two-tenths of one percent”; “The stock market is reacting to news from Washington.” The stock market seems to be everywhere in our daily lives, but what exactly is the stock market? And, what are stocks that are bought and sold on this market? What does it mean for you, for your employer, or for your country’s economy when the stock market had “a good day”?

The answers to these questions are not always obvious once we begin to think about what stocks are. For example, you may have heard that owning stock means that you become an owner of that company. But what does that mean? As an "owner" can you rightfully walk into one of its offices and take home a chair or a desk? Can you hire and fire people? Of course, if you only own a small number of shares, you only “own” a small percentage of the company – but what if you own a majority of the shares, could you then take home a chair or fire workers?

In this tutorial, we will answer these questions and more, often going into some depth to explain core concepts. Once you’ve come to grasp these concepts and understand what makes the stock market tick(运转), the hope is that you’ll become a smarter, more informed, and savvy(精明的) investor. Even if you don’t have a brokerage(经济行) account of your own and invest with  yourown money, you may very well be exposed to stocks via your 401(k) retirement account(美国一种特殊的退休储蓄计划), pension plan, college savings plans, health savings plans, or insurance policies. Once a tool for the rich, the stock market has now turned into the vehicle of choice for growing wealth for many segments of the population. Advances in trading technology and low-cost brokerage services on the internet have opened up stock markets so that today nearly anybody can own stocks with the click of a mouse.

Before proceeding, however, it is important to distinguish between two common uses of the stock market: investing and speculation(投机，猜测). Investing is when you hand over your money so that it is put to use for productive projects such as growth or expansion. Investing in a factory, in research and development, in a new business idea – these are all done with the expectation that in the future, the factory, the research, or the startup(新公司，初创企业) will be worth more than the original investment. That means you have a reason to believe the factory needs to be expanded, or that you understand broadly the type of research being done and what the payoff(报酬) might be, or that you understand and believe in the business plan of the new venture. In other words, investing is a rational decision made with an eye to the future. When you invest, your money is intended to be put to work increasing value.

Speculation, on the other hand, is akin to gambling. Speculators purchase something with the hope that they can soon sell it at a higher price, but without necessarily understanding – or even caring – about why the price should go up. Sometimes, speculators have a gut feeling(直觉), or are trading on rumor, but ultimately they do not concern themselves with the factory, the R&D, or the business plan. Speculation should not always be viewed as a bad thing, however; speculators add liquidity(流动性) to markets, and many have done very well for themselves. At the same time, many smart investors have lost their fortunes in the stock market through speculation. The important distinction between investors and speculators is not a normative(标准的) one, but rather that investors are generally more interested in the processes underlying prices; they are in it for the long haul(长远), while speculators are more interested in the price itself, and with shorter time horizons for making money.

## Stocks Basics: What Are Stocks?

You’ve probably heard a popular definition of what a stock is: “A stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Stock represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings. As you acquire more stock, your ownership stake in the company becomes greater.” Unfortunately, this definition is incorrect in some key ways.

To start with, stock holders(股东) do not own corporations; they own shares issued by corporations. But corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. In other words, corporations file taxes(纳税), can borrow, can own property, can be sued(起诉), etc. The idea that a corporation is a “person” means that the corporation owns its own assets. A corporate office full of chairs and tables belong to the corporation, and not to the shareholders.

This distinction is important because corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability(责任) of both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold – but your personal assets are not at risk. The court cannot even force you to sell your shares, although the value of your shares will have fallen drastically. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, she cannot sell the company’s assets to pay off her creditors(债主).

What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation; and the corporation owns the assets. So if you own 33% of the shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of that company; it is instead correct to state that you own 100% of one-third of the company’s shares. Shareholders cannot do as they please with a corporation or its assets. A shareholder can’t walk out with a chair because the corporation owns that chair, not the shareholder. This is known as the “separation of ownership and control.”

So what good are shares, then, if they aren’t actually the ownership rights we think they are? Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends (which are the company’s profits) if and when they are distributed, and it gives you the right to sell your shares to somebody else.

If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing(任命) its board of directors. This becomes most apparent when one company buys another: the acquiring company doesn’t go around buying up the building, the chairs, the employees; it buys up all the shares. The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation, and often does so by hiring professional managers, or officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.

For ordinary shareholders, not being able to manage the company isn't such a big deal. The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled(享有权利) to a portion of the company's profits, which, as we will see, is the foundation of a stock’s value. The more shares you own, the larger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out dividends(分红派息), and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company. These retained earnings, however, are still reflected in the value of a stock.

Stocks – sometimes referred to as equity or equities – are issued by companies to raise capital in order to grow the business or undertake new projects. There are important distinctions between whether somebody buys shares directly from the company when it issues them (in the primary market) or from another shareholder (on the secondary market). When the corporation issues shares, it does so in return for money.

Companies can instead raise money through borrowing, either directly as a loan(贷款) from a bank, or by issuing debt(发行债权), known as bonds(债权). Bonds are fundamentally different from stocks in a number of ways. First, bondholders are creditors to the corporation, and are entitled to interest as well as repayment of principal. Creditors are given legal priority over other stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will be made whole first if a company is forced to sell assets in order to repay them. Shareholders, on the other hand, are last in line and often receive nothing, or mere pennies on the dollar, in the event of bankruptcy. This implies that stocks are inherently riskier investments that bonds.

The same is true on the upside: bondholders are only entitled to receive the return given by the interest rate agreed upon by the bond, while shareholders can enjoy returns generated by increasing profits, theoretically to infinity. The greater risk attributed to stocks has generally been rewarded by the market. Stocks have historically returned around 8-10% annualized(年化), while bonds return 5-7%.

## Stocks Basics: Different Types Of Stocks

When a company is first founded, the only shareholders are the co-founders and early investors. For example, if a startup has two founders and one investor, each may own one-third of the company’s shares. As the company grows and needs more capital to expand, it may issue more of its shares to other investors, so that the original founders may end up with a substantially lower percentage of shares than they started with. During this stage, the company and its shares are considered private. In most cases, private shares are not easily exchanged, and the number of shareholders is typically small.

As the company continues to grow, however, there often comes a point where early investors become eager to sell their shares and monetize(货币化) the profits of their early investments. At the same time, the company itself may need more investment than the small number of private investors can offer. At this point, the company considers an initial public offering, or IPO, transforming it from a private to a public company.

Aside from the private/public distinction, there are two types of stock that companies can issue: common stock(普通股) and preferred shares(优先股).

### Common Stock

When people talk about stocks they are usually referring to common stock. In fact, the great majority of stock is issued is in this form. Common shares represent a claim on profits (dividends) and confer(授予) voting rights. Investors most often get one vote per share-owned to elect board members who oversee(监督) the major decisions made by management.

Over the long term, common stock, by means of capital growth, has tended to yield higher returns than corporate bonds. This higher return comes at a cost, however, since common stocks entail(意味着) the most risk including the potential to lose the entire amount invested if a company goes out of business. If a company goes bankrupt and liquidates(清算), the common shareholders will not receive money until the creditors, bondholders and preferred shareholders are paid.

### Preferred Stock

Preferred stock functions similarly to bonds, and usually doesn't come with the voting rights (this may vary depending on the company, but in many cases preferred shareholders do not have any voting rights). With preferred shares, investors are usually guaranteed a fixed dividend in perpetuity(永久). This is different from common stock which has variable dividends that are declared by the board of directors and never guaranteed. In fact, many companies do not pay out dividends to common stock at all.

Another advantage is that in the event of liquidation, preferred shareholders are paid off before the common shareholder (but still after debt holders and other creditors). Preferred stock may also be “callable,”(可召回的) meaning that the company has the option to re-purchase the shares from preferred shareholders at any time for any reason (usually for a premium(溢价)). An intuitive way to think of these kinds of shares is to see them as being somewhat in between bonds and common shares.

Common and preferred are the two main forms of stock; however, it's also possible for companies to customize different classes of stock to fit the needs of their investors. The most common reason for creating share classes is for the company to keep voting power concentrated with a certain group. Therefore, different classes of shares are given different voting rights. For example, one class of shares would be held by a select group who are given perhaps ten votes per share while a second class would be issued to the majority of investors who are given just one vote per share. When there is more than one class of stock, the classes are traditionally designated as Class A and Class B, etc.. For example, billionaire(亿万富翁) Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire(伯克希尔) Hathaway has two classes of stock, represented by placing the letter behind the ticker(股票代号) symbol in a form like this: "BRKa, BRKb" or "BRK.A, BRK.B".

## Stocks Basics: How Stocks Trade

We saw in the last section that once a company completes an initial public offering (IPO), its shares become public and can be traded on a stock market. Stock markets are venues(发生地点) where buyers and sellers of shares meet and decide on a price to trade. Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, but increasingly the stock exchanges are virtual, composed of networks of computers where trades are made and recorded electronically.

Stock markets are secondary markets(二级市场), where existing owners of shares can transact with potential buyers. It is important to understand that the corporations listed on stock markets do not buy and sell their own shares on a regular basis (companies may engage in stock buybacks(回购) or issue new shares, but these are not day-to-day operations and often occur outside of the framework of an exchange). So when you buy a share of stock on the stock market, you are not buying it from the company, you are buying it from some other existing shareholder. Likewise, when you sell your shares, you do not sell them back to the company – rather you sell them to some other investor.

The first stock markets appeared in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in port cities or trading hubs such as Antwerp, Amsterdam, and London. These early stock exchanges, however, were more akin to bond exchanges as the small number of companies did not issue equity. In fact, most early corporations were considered semi-public organizations since they had to be chartered(特许) by their government in order to conduct business.

In the late 18th century, stock markets began appearing in America, notably the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which allowed for equity shares to trade (the honor of the first stock exchange in America goes to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange [PHLX], which still exists today). The NYSE was founded in 1792 with the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement by 24 New York City stockbrokers and merchants(商人). Prior to this official incorporation, traders and brokers would meet unofficially under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street to buy and sell shares.

The advent(出现) of modern stock markets ushered(引发、迎接) in an age of regulation(监管) and professionalization that now ensures buyers and sellers of shares can trust that their transactions will go through at fair prices and within a reasonable period of time. Today, there are many stock exchanges in the U.S. and throughout the world, many of which are linked together electronically. This in turn means markets are more efficient and more liquid.

There also exists a number of loosely regulated over-the-counter(非处方) exchanges, sometimes known as bulletin boards, that go by the acronym(缩写) OTCBB. OTCBB shares tend to be more risky since they list companies that fail to meet the more strict listing criteria(标准) of bigger exchanges. For example, larger exchanges may require that a company has been in operation for a certain amount of time before being listed, and that it meets certain conditions regarding company value and profitability. In most developed countries, stock exchanges are self-regulatory organizations (SROs，自律组织), non-governmental organizations(非政府组织) that have the power to create and enforce industry regulations and standards. The priority for stock exchanges is to protect investors through the establishment of rules that promote ethics and equality(伦理和平等). Examples of such SRO’s in the U.S. include individual stock exchanges, as well as the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA, 金融业监管机构).

The prices of shares on a stock market can be set in a number of ways, but most the most common way is through an auction process where buyers and sellers place bids and offers to buy or sell. A bid is the price at which somebody wishes to buy, and an offer (or ask) is the price at which somebody wishes to sell. When the bid and ask coincide(同时发生), a trade is made.

Some stock markets rely on professional traders to maintain continuous bids and offers since a motivated buyer or seller may not find each other at any given moment. These are known as specialists or market makers. A two-sided market consists of the bid(买方出价) and the offer(卖方要价), and the spread(买卖差价) is the difference in price between the bid and the offer. The more narrow the price spread and the larger size of the bids and offers (the amount of shares on each side), the greater the liquidity(流动性) of the stock. Moreover, if there are many buyers and sellers at sequentially(按序的，不会跳空) higher and lower prices, the market is said to have good depth. Stock markets of high quality generally tend to have small bid-ask spreads, high liquidity, and good depth. Likewise, individual stocks of high quality, large companies tend to have the same characteristics.

In addition to individual stocks, many investors are concerned with stock indices (also called indexes). Indices represent aggregated prices of a number of different stocks, and the movement of an index is the net effect of the movements of each individual component. When people talk about the stock market, they often are actually referring to one of the major indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500.

The DJIA is a price-weighted index of 30 large American corporations. Because of its weighting scheme and that it only consists of 30 stocks – when there are many thousand to choose from – it is not really a good indicator of how the stock market is doing. The S&P 500 is a market cap-weighted index of the 500 largest companies in the U.S., and is a much more valid indicator. Indices can be broad such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500, or they can be specific to a certain industry or market sector. Investors can trade indices indirectly via futures markets(期货市场), or via exchange traded funds (ETFs), which trade like stocks on stock exchanges. (See also: Opinion: Dow 20,000 Is Stupid.)

## Stocks Basics: Trading Stocks and Order Types

In this section, we discuss the practical matter of going about buying and selling shares of stock. Individuals typically buy and sell shares by using a licensed brokerage firm(持牌经纪公司) or broker who makes the actual trade. Historically, stockbrokers were hired only by wealthy individuals and families, but today a wide range of brokerages exist for all price ranges. So-called “full-service”(全方位服务) brokers offer a suite of research, opinion, and expert advice and can offer a personal relationship between the broker and the client. For more budget conscious(预算意识) clients, discount brokerages exist that offer a much more bare-bones service(裸机服务) offering, in some cases simply executing purchases and sales. Over the past two decades, electronic trading has grown significantly, with many online brokerages offering both research and opinion as well as trades at low prices, some asking as little as $5 or less per trade in commission(交易佣金). (See also: Picking Your First Broker.)

Regardless of the type of brokerage used, the mechanics(机制) of buying or selling shares is fairly uniform. First, a stock quote(股票报价) is obtained. In the early days of stock exchanges, price information was transmitted via tickertape​(股票发报机) – a long ribbon of paper that printed basic data via telegraph wire. That is why today we still refer to stock quotes as the ticker.

A stock quote carries a lot of information including the current bid and offer (sometimes called the ask) prices as well as the last price that traded. The bid is the highest price that somebody in the market is willing to pay at a given time, while the offer is the lowest price that somebody is willing to sell. If you are interested in buying shares, you will make a bid, and if you want to sell an offer. When the price of a bid and offer coincide, a trade is effected.

In addition to this price information, data on trading volume(成交量) (number of shares traded) is often included. Stock quotes obtained online are often real-time quotes that confer second-by-second details, and online quotes also often include charts and interactive tools. Stocks are quoted by their ticker symbol, represented by between one and four capital letters(一到四个字母), which are often loosely representative of the company name. For example the ticker symbol for Microsoft Corp. is MSFT​, Caterpillar Inc(卡特彼勒公司). is CAT, and Apple Inc. is AAPL​.

### Market Orders and Limit Orders

Next, the type of trade has to be determined. A market order is simply an order that instructs the broker (or online trading platform) to buy or sell shares at the best available price. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of AAPL at market, and the quote shows: Bid: $139.80 (100), Offer: $140.00 (50), Last: $139.95 (250). This tells us that the last trade was 250 shares at $139.50 and it indicates 50 shares are offered at $140.00. Suppose another 200 are offered at $140.05. Your market order would buy the 50 shares at $140.00 and then purchase 50 more at the next best price at $140.05.

A market order does not guarantee the price you will get, but it does guarantee that you will get the number of shares that you want, in this case 100. When an order is completed, it is said to be filled. A market order is most often used in cases where the buyer or seller is most concerned with filling the size of the order and not concerned with the price. A limit order specifies the price at which you want to trade. For example, you may specify that you want to buy AAPL for $140.00 but no more, in which case you would buy the 50 shares offered at $140.00 and then wait for some other seller to come down to your price. Until that happens, the new quote would be Bid: $140.00 (50), Offer: $140.05 (200), Last: $140.00 (50).

A limit order can also be designated all-or-none (AON), meaning that you won’t agree to buy your shares unless you can get all 100 that you want. If the original limit order in this example were AON, you would not buy the 50 that are offered until another 50 came along. Limit orders are used by those who are primarily concerned with the price they want to receive, but they are not guaranteed that the size of their order will be filled. Price versus getting filled on the size of your order are the primary trade-offs between market and limit orders.

### Stop Orders

Stop orders are contingent(依情况而定) on a certain price level being attained to activate the trade. With a stop order, your trade will be executed only when the security you want to buy or sell reaches a particular price (the stop price). Once the stock has reached this price, a stop order essentially becomes a market order and is filled. For instance, if you own stock ABC, which currently trades at $20, and you place a stop order to sell it at $15, your order will only be filled once stock ABC drops below $15. Also known as a stop-loss order(止损单), this allows you to limit your losses.

This type of order can also be used to guarantee profits. For example, assume that you bought stock XYZ at $10 per share and now the stock is trading at $20 per share. Placing a stop order at $15 will guarantee profits of approximately $5 per share, depending on how quickly the market order can be filled. Stop orders are particularly advantageous(有利的) to investors who are unable to monitor their stocks for a period of time, and brokerages may even set these stop orders for no charge.

One disadvantage of the stop order is that the order is not guaranteed to be filled at the preferred price the investor states. Once the stop order has been triggered, it turns into a market order, which is filled at the best possible price. This price may be lower than the price specified by the stop order. Moreover, investors must be conscientious(煞费苦心的) about where they set a stop order. It may be unfavorable(不利) if it is activated by a short-term fluctuation(波动) in the stock's price. For example, if stock ABC is relatively volatile(波动性) and fluctuates by 15% on a weekly basis, a stop-loss set at 10% below the current price may result in the order being triggered at an inopportune(不合适的) or premature(过早的) time.

### Other Kinds of Orders

Orders may also be tagged with instructions regarding how long an order is good for. An immediate-or-cancel (IOC) order is cancelled if the order isn’t executed right away. This is typically used in conjunction with a limit order. When an IOC order is combined with an AON order, it is designated fill-or-kill (FOK). A day order is a limit or stop order that is cancelled at the end of the trading day, and will not be active the next morning. A good-til-canceled​ (GTC) order is active until the instruction is given to cancel it, and may remain active for many days at a time or longer.

### Margin Trading and Short Selling

In addition to the mechanics described above, many brokerages offer margin trading(保证金交易), allowing their customers to borrow money to buy shares in excess of the amount of cash in their account. Margin also allows for short selling(卖空，做空), which is where a market participant borrows shares they do not own in order to sell them with the hope of buying them back in the future at a lower price. A short seller is betting that the price of a stock will go down, rather than up.

In addition to using a brokerage, there are two less common ways to own shares: dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs, 股利再投资计划) and direct investment plans (DIPs, 直接投资计划). DIPs are plans by which individual companies, for a minimal cost, allow shareholders to purchase stock directly from the company. DRIPs are where the dividends paid by shares are automatically used to purchase more of those shares (including fractions of a share).

## Stocks Basics: Bulls, Bears & Market Sentiment

Investors often have differing opinions about particular stocks or about the direction of the economy as a whole. Each trading day is analogous to a struggle between optimists and pessimists who buy and sell at various prices given different expectations. The stock market is said to incorporate all of the information that exists about the companies it represents, and that manifests(清楚显示) itself as price. When optimists dominate, prices trend upwards, and we say that we are in a bull market. When the opposite is true, and prices trend lower, we are in a bear market.

A bull market is when everything in the economy is running objectively(客观的) well: people are finding jobs and unemployment(失业率) is low, the economy is growing as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), and stocks are rising. Picking stocks during a bull market is arguably(可论证的) easier because everything is going up. If a person is optimistic and believes that stocks will go up, he or she is called a bull and is said to have a bullish outlook(前景). Bull markets cannot last forever though, and sometimes they can lead to dangerous situations if stocks become overvalued(过于高估). In fact, one severe form of a bull market is known as a bubble, where the upward trajectory(轨迹) of stock prices no longer conforms to fundamentals, and optimistic sentiment(情绪、感觉) completely takes over. Historically, bubbles have occurred regularly dating back to the Dutch Tulipmania of the 1600’s – where the price of tulip bulbs(郁金香灯泡) rose so high that one could be worth more than a house – through to the housing bubble of 2008 that sparked the Great Recession. Bubbles always burst when reality catches up with overinflated(过度膨胀的) prices, and people often realize bubbles in hindsight(事后一想). It is difficult to recognize when investors are in a bubble and even harder to predict when it will pop.

A bear market is informally defined as a 20% drop in broad indices. Bear markets happen when the economy appears to be in or near recession(衰退), unemployment rises, corporate profits fall, and GDP contracts(收紧，下降). Bear markets make it tough for investors to pick profitable stocks. One solution to this is to profit from when stocks are falling via short selling(卖空). Another strategy is to wait on the sidelines(以旁观者的角度) until you feel that the bear market is nearing its end, only starting to buy in anticipation of a bull market.

Bear markets are typically associated with an increase in stock market volatility(波动性), since investors typically fear losses more than they appreciate gains at an emotional level. People are not always rational(理性的) actors – especially when it comes to money and investments. During bear markets, prices do not drop in an orderly or rational way to some fundamental level of price-to-earnings, but rather market participants often overreact in panic(过度恐慌) and send prices below reasonable valuations.

When there is panic, there is fear. Irrational behavior can spread, and markets can collapse. Expectations about future cash flows essentially drop to zero and people become more concerned with converting investments into cash than future growth. Only when rational investing behavior is restored does a bear market turn a corner. It is also worth pointing out that bear markets can be great opportunities for long-term investors to buy stocks “on sale” at relatively low prices, which can actually boost overall returns over long time horizons(视野，眼界).

## Stocks Basics: How to Read A Stock Table/Quote

Any financial paper has stock quotes that will look something like the image below:

Columns 1 & 2: 52-Week High and Low - These are the highest and lowest prices at which a stock has traded over the previous 52 weeks (one year). This typically does not include the previous day's trading.

Column 3: Company Name & Type of Stock - This column lists the name of the company. If there are no special symbols or letters following the name, it is common stock. Different symbols imply different classes of shares. For example, "pf" means the shares are preferred stock.

Column 4: Ticker Symbol - This is the unique alphabetic name which identifies the stock. If you watch financial TV, you have seen the ticker tape move across the screen, quoting the latest prices alongside this symbol. If you are looking for stock quotes online, you always search for a company by the ticker symbol. If you don't know what a particular company's ticker is you can search for it at: http://finance.yahoo.com/l.

Column 5: Dividend Per Share - This indicates the annual dividend payment per share. If this space is blank, the company does not currently pay out dividends.

Column 6: Dividend Yield - The percentage return on the dividend. Calculated as annual dividends per share divided by price per share.

Column 7: Price/Earnings Ratio - This is calculated by dividing the current stock price by earnings per share from the last four quarters. For more detail on how to interpret this, see our P/E Ratio tutorial.

Column 8: Trading Volume - This figure shows the total number of shares traded for the day, listed in hundreds. To get the actual number traded, add "00" to the end of the number listed.

Column 9 & 10: Day High and Low - This indicates the price range at which the stock has traded at throughout the day. In other words, these are the maximum and the minimum prices that people have paid for the stock.

Column 11: Close - The close is the last trading price recorded when the market closed on the day. If the closing price is up or down more than 5% than the previous day's close, the entire listing for that stock is bold-faced. Keep in mind, you are not guaranteed to get this price if you buy the stock the next day because the price is constantly changing (even after the exchange is closed for the day). The close is merely an indicator of past performance and except in extreme circumstances serves as a ballpark of what you should expect to pay.

Column 12: Net Change - This is the dollar value change in the stock price from the previous day's closing price. When you hear about a stock being "up for the day," it means the net change was positive.

Quotes on the Internet

Nowadays, it's far more convenient for most to get stock quotes off the Internet. This method is superior because most sites update throughout the day and give you more information, news, charting, research, etc.

Compare how different online brokerages display stock prices by visiting our Brokerage Review Center.

To get quotes, simply enter the ticker symbol into the quote box of any major financial site like Yahoo! Finance, CBS Marketwatch, or MSN Money. The example below shows a quote for Microsoft (MSFT) from Yahoo Finance. Interpreting the data is exactly the same as with the newspaper.

## Stocks Basics: Valuing Stocks

Stock prices change often (sometimes many times a minute) as the result of market forces. By this we mean that share prices change because of fluctuations in their supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock at a given moment (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. In our previous example of buying Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock with a market order, the purchase caused the price to increase to $140.05. Conversely, if more people are motivated to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall. Of course, for any trade to actually happen there needs to be exactly one buyer and one seller – so the number of buyers and sellers is technically the same. What we mean here is the number of motivated buyers or sellers, i.e. those that are willing to buy for higher or sell for lower.

The price of a stock represents the “value” of the corporation. At its most basic level, this value is computed by dividing the dollar value of the company, known as the market capitalization (or “market cap”) by the number of shares outstanding. For example, if XYZ Corp. is valued at $1,000,000 and it has 100,000 shares outstanding, the price of each share is $10.00. Working backwards, one can determine the market value of a company thus by multiplying the share price by the number of shares. The question then becomes what causes fluctuations in the value of the corporation?

But what does a company’s value represent? A company has stuff and it sells stuff. The stuff it has – buildings, machinery, patents, money in the bank, etc. – constitute its book value(账面价值), or the amount of money a company would get if they sold all that stuff at once. But companies are primarily in business of trying to make a profit, and in doing so they earn cash by selling products or services, so the total value of a company has to do with the stuff it owns now and the cash flows it will receive in the future. The value of the stuff it owns now is fairly easy to determine, but the value of all the future cash flow streams is a bit trickier to nail down(明确) – and it is this piece that is responsible for market gyrations(旋转).

Because of the time value of money, profits to be earned in the future must be discounted back to represent today’s dollars – just as a dollar put into a bank account today will be worth more in the future after it has earned some interest, but in reverse. How much to discount these future cash flows depends on a lot of things including the cost of capital (which is the cost to borrow or find investment, and this depends on interest rates), the riskiness of the business (in the stock market this is often estimated using beta(贝塔风险因子)), and the foregone(预先决定的) cost of doing nothing and keeping your money in the bank (the opportunity cost or risk-free rate).

Once an appropriate discount rate has been estimated, the hard part is to figure out what future cash flows will be – a month from now, a year from now, five years from now. Sentiment and expectations are a big component of these predictions, and financial analysts try to figure these amounts out in a number of ways accounting for both company-specific factors and macro factors such as overall economic health. Fortunately, the stock market reflects the expectation of future cash flows in an easy to compute ratio of price-to-earnings, also known as the P/E ratio. A P/E ratio of 10x means that a company is being valued today at 10x its current earnings. A P/E ratio of 20x for the same company would mean that given the same amount of earnings, the market is giving it twice as much value, indicating that those future cash flows are going to be larger. Of course, there are a number of sophisticated pricing models that analysts can use in addition, or instead of, the P/E ratio such as using dividend discount models or free cash flow models.

Because the future is unknown today, various peoples’ estimates will be different from one another, giving some a higher expected stock price and some a lower stock price. If the current price is lower than their expected price, people will buy it. If it is higher, people will sell it. When an economy is growing, people are spending and profits are rising. Companies invest in projects, expand their businesses and hire more people. Investors are optimistic and expectations of future cash flows rise, and stocks enter a bull market. Simply put, stock markets can fall when expectations of future cash flows decrease, making the prices of companies seem too high, therefore causing people to sell shares. If many more people come to this decision than there are people to buy those shares, the price will fall until it reaches a level where people will begin to believe that they are fairly valued.

Stock prices change often (sometimes many times a minute) as the result of market forces. By this we mean that share prices change because of fluctuations in their supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock at a given moment (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. In our previous example of buying Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock with a market order, the purchase caused the price to increase to $140.05. Conversely, if more people are motivated to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall. Of course, for any trade to actually happen there needs to be exactly one buyer and one seller – so the number of buyers and sellers is technically the same. What we mean here is the number of motivated buyers or sellers, i.e. those that are willing to buy for higher or sell for lower.

The price of a stock represents the “value” of the corporation. At its most basic level, this value is computed by dividing the dollar value of the company, known as the market capitalization (or “market cap”) by the number of shares outstanding. For example, if XYZ Corp. is valued at $1,000,000 and it has 100,000 shares outstanding, the price of each share is $10.00. Working backwards, one can determine the market value of a company thus by multiplying the share price by the number of shares. The question then becomes what causes fluctuations in the value of the corporation?

But what does a company’s value represent? A company has stuff and it sells stuff. The stuff it has – buildings, machinery, patents, money in the bank, etc. – constitute its book value, or the amount of money a company would get if they sold all that stuff at once. But companies are primarily in business of trying to make a profit, and in doing so they earn cash by selling products or services, so the total value of a company has to do with the stuff it owns now and the cash flows it will receive in the future. The value of the stuff it owns now is fairly easy to determine, but the value of all the future cash flow streams is a bit trickier to nail down – and it is this piece that is responsible for market gyrations.

The important things to grasp about this complicated subject are the following:

1. At the most fundamental level, supply and demand in the market determines stock price in any given moment.

2. Price times the number of shares outstanding (market capitalization，总市值) is the value of a company. Comparing just the share price of two companies is meaningless.

3. Theoretically, earnings(盈利) are what affect investors' valuation of a company, but there are other indicators that investors use to predict stock price. It is investors' sentiments, attitudes and expectations that ultimately affect stock prices.

4. There are many competing theories that try to explain the way stock prices move the way they do. Unfortunately, there is no one theory that can explain everything.

## Stocks Basics: Conclusion

Let’s recap some of the main points we’ve learned in this tutorial:

- Stocks are claims to a company’s profit stream and are granted voting rights in installing its board of directors or in approving large corporate actions such as being acquired. Shareholders are not owners of a corporation’s assets and do not involve themselves with corporate management.

- Stock is equity, bonds are debt. Bondholders are guaranteed a return on their investment and have a higher claim in recovery from a bankruptcy than shareholders. This is generally why stocks are considered riskier investments and require a higher expected rate of return.

- You can lose all of your investment with stocks. The flip-side of this is you can make a lot of money if you invest in the right company.

- The two main types of stock are common and preferred. It is also possible for a company to create different classes of stock.

- Stock markets are places where buyers and sellers of stock meet to trade. Most trading takes place today via electronic trading.

- Stock market indexes give an overview to how the stock market is “doing.”

- Stock prices change moment to moment according to supply and demand. There are many factors influencing prices, the most important of which is expectations about earnings. Still, there is no consensus(一致意见) as to why stock prices move the way they do.

- To buy stocks you can either use a brokerage or a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).

- There are a number of different order types, and the type of order you use will depend on whether you are more concerned with price or with completing your order.

- Stock tables/quotes actually aren't that hard to read once you know what everything stands for!

- Bulls are optimistic and bull markets are defined by increasing stock prices. Bears are pessimists and bear markets occur when prices fall.
